		 For this week, your assignment will be a little different. You will be working in Eclipse (or your favorite IDE) to write/run your code.

You are tasked with analyzing a relatively sizeable (12MB) dataset of computer science research papers written from 1950 to 2008. You can download the dataset here:

http://content.ktbyte.com/papers.txt

(You should download the dataset as save it as at root of your Eclipse project. Please do not use the getTextFromURL() function we used in class for reading the dataset from online as it can hog a lot of bandwidth from our web server.)

Please be sure to download the entire file. The last line of the file is:

1980       ZUERICH      Paul & Simon, Decision Trees and Random Access Machines

Your programm will read the content of the file. You may use the code provided here as a starting point (feel free to modify it as you see fit):

http://content.ktbyte.com/AuthorshipAnalyzer.java

Each line in the file contains a research paper title and authorship information. For example, in the following line, there are two authors (Fink and Mao):
1999       4THESTATE    Fink & Mao, The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie:  The Science and Aesthetics of Tie Knots

In the above example, we can see that Fink coauthored a paper with Mao (and vice versa). Note that it is possible for more than 2 people to coauthor the same paper.

In this assignment you will write a program to analyze coauthorship relationships and answer the following questions:

1. Who has collaborated with the most number of authors?
2. How many authors only 1 coauthorship?

The AuthorshipAnalyzer.java starter code should help you with this assignment. Note that it suggests using a  HashMap<String, Set<String>> to map authors to a set of other authors he/she collaborated with (why is this an appropriate choice of data structure?)

Note that the dataset contains only last names for authors for each paper. For the purpose of this exercise, we will treat any two authors with the same last name as the same person. It may even be possible for two authors with the same last name to publish a paper; in the case, we do not count that towards coauthorship.

What to hand in:
Please submit the answers to the above 2 questions in an email to your instructor with "CS02b Assignment 6" as the subject line, along with an attachment of the code that you wrote to come up with the answers.
